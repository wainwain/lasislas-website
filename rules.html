        <p>
          Staff may modify rules, enforcement procedures, and penalties at any time, with or without notice.
          Violating the spirit of a rule can result in the same penalty as directly breaking it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out-of-character insults, personal attacks, or any form of harassment are strictly forbidden 
          and will result in a permanent ban.
        </p>
        <p>
          Racism, sexism, hate speech, or any other form of abusive or discriminatory language 
          will result in an immediate permanent ban.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Las Islas Filipinas is set in an alternate universe, any roleplay depicting oppression, 
          slavery, or prostitution is strictly prohibited. Any roleplay or content promoting violence 
          or abuse based on gender, race, or similar factors is not permitted. Historical events may differ 
          from reality, but they do not allow for discriminatory or abusive storylines.

      <div class="rules-panel">
        <h3>1. Language & Server Demographics</h3>
      <p>
        Las Islas Filipinas is a Philippine-based server, but all in-character communication must be in 
        <strong>Filipino or English</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deliberate avoidance of communication</strong> (i.e., “Avoiding RP”) is subject to sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server is <strong>18+</strong> due to mature themes, sensitive content, and explicit language 
        that may arise in both gameplay and roleplay.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Communication & Immersion</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Good microphone quality</strong> is encouraged to enhance immersion and minimize disruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If conflicts or rule breaches occur in-game, <strong>continue roleplaying</strong> until the scenario ends. 
        Then, submit a report via the Support Ticket channel on Discord.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Out-of-character (OOC) arguments</strong> are not allowed; handle disputes through proper channels 
        outside of the game.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Roleplay Quality & Staff Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        Players must maintain a <strong>high standard of roleplay</strong> at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        If staff deems your roleplay subpar or harmful to the server atmosphere, you may be placed under 
        <strong>evaluation</strong> and could face disciplinary actions.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Cheating, Exploits & Third-Party Software</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Glitches, exploits, hacks, or any form of bug abuse</strong> for personal gain are strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Script/resource injection or hacking</strong> results in an 
        <strong>irreversible permanent ban</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Report any encountered glitches or exploits to staff immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Prohibited Roleplay Themes</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Erotic or 18+ sexual roleplay</strong> of any kind is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> and 
        will result in a permanent ban.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any roleplay suggesting <strong>forced relationships</strong>, <strong>rape</strong>, 
        or similarly disturbing themes is likewise banned.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Suicide or self-harm roleplay</strong> is not allowed and will result in corrective actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roleplay <strong>involving the supernatural</strong> is also prohibited unless you have explicit staff 
        approval via a Support Channel request.
      </p>

      <h3>6. RP over Gunplay</h3>
      <p>
        Las Islas Filipinas is a <strong>serious roleplay</strong> server, grounded in a realistic setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Violence or killing must be justified by <strong>solid in-character reasoning</strong> and a natural 
        progression of the scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emphasize <strong>roleplay</strong> over quick or senseless violence.

    <div class="rules-collapse">
      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Bans and other Disciplinary Procedures</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <h3>1. Communication & 18+ Policy</h3>
      <p>
        All in-character (IC) communication must be conducted in <strong>Filipino or English</strong> to 
        ensure clarity between players. Deliberate avoidance of RP communication (i.e., “Avoiding RP”) 
        may lead to sanctions. Las Islas Filipinas is an <strong>18+ community</strong> due to mature themes 
        and explicit content; by participating, players acknowledge and agree to these conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Maintaining Immersion & Resolving Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        Effective communication is crucial for immersive roleplay. A <strong>good quality microphone</strong> 
        is encouraged to minimize disruptions. If rule-breaking or disagreements arise, remain in-character 
        until the scenario ends. Then, file a report via the Support Ticket channel on Discord. 
        Out-of-character (OOC) arguments are not tolerated and must be settled through proper channels 
        outside of the game. For urgent matters, contact staff via the available <strong>Support Channels</strong> 
        on Discord, providing clips or recordings if possible.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Roleplay Quality & Staff Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        The staff upholds high standards of roleplay. If your overall roleplay quality is deemed 
        <strong>subpar</strong> or <strong>harmful</strong> to other players, you may be placed under 
        <strong>evaluation</strong> and could face disciplinary actions.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Prohibited Content</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Erotic or 18+ roleplay</strong> of any kind is strictly disallowed and results in an 
        immediate permanent ban. Any roleplay involving <strong>forced relationships</strong>, 
        <strong>rape</strong>, or related themes is also permanently bannable. Similarly, 
        <strong>suicide or self-harm roleplay</strong> of any kind is prohibited and leads to 
        corrective actions. Our priority is to maintain a safe and respectful environment.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Serious Roleplay & Supernatural Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Las Islas Filipinas is a <strong>serious roleplay</strong> server, and all scenarios must 
        remain grounded in a believable reality. <strong>Supernatural roleplay</strong> is allowed 
        only if explicitly approved by staff through a Support Channel request.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Roleplay Over Gunplay</h3>
      <p>
        We encourage meaningful <strong>roleplay</strong> over quick violence. Actions leading to 
        harm or killing another player must have <strong>sufficient in-character reasoning</strong> 
        and a logical progression. Senseless violence that lacks proper RP buildup is discouraged 
        and may result in disciplinary measures.

      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Disciplinary Actions and Appeals</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <h3>1. Internal Review Process</h3>
      <p>
        All bans and other disciplinary decisions are reviewed by the Las Islas Filipinas staff. 
        These actions require a <strong>majority vote</strong> by the staff members.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. Ban Policy & Appeals</h3>
      <p>
        Disciplinary actions taken against a player are <strong>final</strong>. However, banned 
        individuals may <strong>appeal</strong> their ban every <strong>7 days</strong>. 
        A player may only receive up to <strong>3 bans</strong> before their ban becomes <strong>permanent</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>3. Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        All information regarding disciplinary measures remains <strong>confidential</strong> 
        between the involved player(s) and staff. The staff may disclose details about a ban 
        only when <strong>necessary</strong>. In player-to-player complaints, staff may also 
        inform the reporting player that <strong>appropriate actions</strong> have been taken 
        against the offender.

      <div class="rules-panel">
        <h3>1. Official Communication Channels</h3>
      <p>
        All official staff communications must take place through the server's 
        <strong>official Discord</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. Direct Messages to Staff</h3>
      <p>
        We <strong>discourage</strong> contacting staff members directly. For player reports, 
        bug reports, or other server-related concerns, please use the <strong>designated 
        server channels</strong>. All such communications will be treated with 
        <strong>confidentiality</strong> and documented appropriately.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Respectful Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Disrespectful or discourteous behavior towards staff or community members may lead to 
        <strong>corrective measures</strong>. In severe cases, a <strong>ban</strong> may be applied 
        to maintain a respectful server environment.

      <div class="rules-panel">
        <h3>1. Authentic Portrayals</h3>
      <p>
        Las Islas Filipinas emphasizes <strong>authentic character portrayal</strong>. 
        Your character’s traits—such as <strong>sexual orientation</strong>, 
        <strong>age</strong>, and other defining attributes—must be reflected consistently 
        in your roleplay.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Roleplaying Minors</h3>
      <p>
        Characters who are <strong>children or teenagers</strong> must be roleplayed in a way 
        that’s realistic for their age and the server’s timeline. Any behavior deemed 
        <strong>unrealistic</strong> for a minor may be considered <strong>Fail RP</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>3. Server Timeline & Backstories</h3>
      <p>
        All characters and backstories must align with the server’s 
        <strong>established timeline</strong>. <strong>Rapid aging</strong> or creating 
        <strong>unrealistic or inconsistent backstories</strong> is strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Independent Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Characters you create cannot be <strong>related to or connected with</strong> your 
        other characters. While playing relatives of <strong>other players’ characters</strong> 
        is allowed, your new characters should not share familial ties, history, or knowledge 
        with your own previously created characters. Each of your characters must have a 
        <strong>fresh, independent story</strong>.

        <h3>1. Authentic & Meaningful</h3>
      <p>
        In Las Islas Filipinas, <strong>character</strong> and <strong>organization</strong> names 
        (including gangs) should be <strong>authentic</strong>, <strong>thoughtful</strong>, 
        and <strong>immersive</strong>. Names taken directly from movies, novels, TV shows, 
        pop culture, or historical references are <strong>strictly prohibited</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. Fitting the Setting</h3>
      <p>
        Unrealistic names or names that appear <strong>trollish</strong> are not allowed. 
        Your chosen name must <strong>fit the server’s setting</strong> and enhance the 
        overall depth of your roleplay experience.

  <section id="downed" data-scroll-spy>
    <div class="rules-collapse">
      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Downed, Unconscious and Permadeath</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <h3>1. Player States</h3>
      <h4>Downed State</h4>
      <p>
        A player in the <strong>Downed State</strong> can still speak but is physically incapacitated.
        They may remember everything that happens around them while downed.
      </p>
      <h4>Unconscious State</h4>
      <p>
        A player in the <strong>Unconscious State</strong> is unable to speak and may only communicate 
        via <code>/me</code> medical status updates. Once treated, the unconscious player 
        <strong>cannot remember</strong> the events leading to their injuries.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Medical Assistance & Post-Injury Roleplay</h3>
      <p>
        After being downed or rendered unconscious, players may send an alert for 
        <strong>medical assistance</strong>. This request should not be used to escalate personal disputes 
        or ongoing conflicts. Once treated, players must use the <code>/status</code> command to 
        describe their injuries and adhere to the medical practitioner’s recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Injuries must be <strong>roleplayed realistically</strong>. Failure to acknowledge or portray 
        injuries accurately may be deemed <strong>Fail RP</strong>, undermining the server’s immersive 
        environment.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Permadeath & New Life Rule (NLR)</h3>
      <p>
        Players <strong>cannot force</strong> others to permanently kill or retire their characters. 
        The <strong>severity and location of injuries</strong> are at the discretion of the injured player. 
        <strong>Torturing</strong> or <strong>permanently maiming</strong> a character is prohibited 
        without explicit <strong>OOC consent</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a player sustains a <strong>fatal blow</strong> (e.g., a headshot), they cannot be revived by 
        medical practitioners and must invoke the <strong>New Life Rule (NLR)</strong>. This ends their 
        current storyline, and they must start anew, either with a fresh storyline for the same character 
        or a completely new character. This structure ensures fairness and immersive roleplay for all.
      </p>

  <section id="value" data-scroll-spy>
    <div class="rules-collapse">
      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Value of Life</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          Las Islas Filipinas emphasizes a <strong>roleplay-first</strong> environment. 
          Characters should behave as real people would, especially regarding self-preservation. 
          While personalities may vary—some more fearless, others more cautious—violent or risky choices 
          must still make sense in a <strong>realistic, life-threatening context</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Not Valuing Life (NVL)</h3>
        <p>
          Frequent <strong>vigilantism</strong>, drawing weapons without cause, or engaging in 
          <strong>reckless, violent actions</strong> that would likely end in serious injury or death 
          may be considered NVL. For instance, <strong>charging at an armed opponent</strong> aiming 
          a gun at you is typically unrealistic and thus counted as NVL.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          As a <strong>civilian</strong>, it's essential to react in a believable way when threatened 
          by outlaws. In most cases, a civilian would prioritize <strong>survival</strong> over 
          material possessions or intervening in a robbery unless there’s a significant personal reason.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Examples of Valuing Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Example 1:</strong> You and a friend are alone, surrounded by six armed bandits. 
            Refusing to comply when outnumbered is considered NVL. However, if you hold a 
            <strong>defensible position</strong> against a smaller gang intent on killing you, 
            standing your ground may be justified because you have some chance of survival.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example 2:</strong> You witness a robbery involving two bandits and two victims. 
            Intervening could jeopardize <strong>multiple lives</strong>. It’s more realistic to let 
            the robbery proceed, then aid the victims afterward and inform the law. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example 3:</strong> As a <strong>bandit</strong>, walking into a busy town or 
            storming a sheriff's station to rob everyone is highly <strong>unrealistic</strong>. 
            Law enforcement, witnesses, and other factors create severe risks. 
            Engaging in unplanned, reckless behavior can be seen as <strong>Fail RP</strong>. 
            Instead, consider more strategic or lower-risk opportunities consistent with your 
            character’s motivations.

          If you are uncertain whether an action might be considered a <strong>failure to value your life</strong>, 
          consult the <strong>support bot</strong> for clarification. Always maintain <strong>realism 
          and immersion</strong> to enhance everyone’s roleplay experience.

      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          <strong>Random Deathmatch (RDM)</strong> refers to any deliberate aggressive action 
          taken against another player or NPC <strong>without proper roleplay build-up 
          or verbal interaction</strong> beforehand. 
        </p>
  
        <h3>Examples of RDM</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Randomly roping/hogtying, shooting, stabbing, or striking players.</li>
          <li>Randomly roping/hogtying, shooting, stabbing, or striking NPCs 
            (treated the same as players in terms of consequences).</li>
          <li>Planning or declaring an intention to commit violence without prior roleplay 
            or verbal warning.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Best Practices for Avoiding RDM</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Create a scene:</strong> Always build up to violence with roleplay. 
          Engage in conversation or other forms of interaction before escalating.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Allow a verbal response:</strong> Give the other character a chance to respond 
          or prepare for what’s coming, ensuring a dynamic and immersive exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Indicate imminent violence:</strong> Use visible cues or verbal warnings to show 
          you are prepared to act (e.g., hand-on-holster stance, explicit <code>/me</code> actions, 
          taking cover, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roleplay harm with NPCs:</strong> If harming NPCs is necessary, 
          provide proper roleplay context. Remember, actions against NPCs can have 
          <strong>in-character consequences</strong> just as they would with players.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          By following these guidelines, you’ll help maintain an <strong>immersive 
          and engaging environment</strong> where all violence is justified and 
          meaningful within the roleplay narrative.

  <section id="shootouts" data-scroll-spy>
    <div class="rules-collapse">
      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Shootouts</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          In Las Islas Filipinas, shootouts are meant to be <strong>immersive, engaging</strong>, 
          and rooted in solid roleplay. Before initiating a firefight, it’s crucial to 
          <strong>extend the roleplay</strong> so all parties are aware that violence is imminent, 
          allowing them to prepare and respond realistically. 
        </p>
  
        <h3>1. Initiating a Shootout</h3>
        <p>
          Clearly signal that <strong>PvP</strong> is about to begin, giving the opposing side 
          time to seek cover or otherwise react. Avoid immediately rushing to down opponents; 
          the goal is to <strong>foster a dynamic narrative</strong>, not simply “win.” 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Use cover strategically, fire suppressive shots, and <strong>engage vocally</strong> 
          to enhance immersion. Execution animations should be reserved for close-quarters 
          situations where the target is <strong>already subdued</strong> and lacks any chance 
          to fight back (e.g., after a kidnapping).
        </p>
  
        <h3>2. Law Enforcement Interactions</h3>
        <p>
          If law enforcement is involved—particularly for characters <strong>wanted</strong> 
          for serious crimes—officers will issue multiple verbal commands before escalating 
          to lethal force. If criminals refuse to comply after several warnings (e.g., during 
          a bank robbery escape), law enforcement may justifiably <strong>open fire</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <h3>3. Rival Gang Situations</h3>
        <p>
          When tension between rival gangs has built up over multiple sessions (verbal or 
          physical conflicts), a shootout may become imminent. Still, provide <strong>some form 
          of verbal confrontation</strong> before initiating violence. For instance, if one gang 
          corners another with drawn weapons, it’s reasonable for a shootout to start quickly 
          after an initial verbal exchange.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The key is ensuring <strong>everyone understands</strong> that a shootout is happening 
          and that the escalation follows logical roleplay. Taking time to build the scene 
          gradually avoids confusion and creates a <strong>dynamic, realistic</strong>, 
          and enjoyable experience for all.

  <section id="meta" data-scroll-spy>
    <div class="rules-collapse">
      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Meta Gaming</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          <strong>Meta-gaming</strong> is using knowledge, information, or details that 
          your character could not realistically have learned through normal 
          <strong>in-character</strong> (IC) experiences. This includes insights gained 
          from live streams, videos, out-of-character (OOC) chats, or any other 
          external source. Engaging in meta-gaming is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> 
          and may result in staff evaluation and <strong>disciplinary action</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <h3>1. IC Knowledge vs. Player Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          Your character can only act on what they have <strong>seen, heard, or experienced</strong> 
          in the game world. While you, as a player, may possess additional information, 
          using it to gain an advantage is considered <strong>unfair and immersion-breaking</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <h3>2. Separate Storylines & Characters</h3>
        <p>
          Meta-gaming also covers transferring knowledge or conflicts between 
          <strong>different characters</strong>. Each alternate character should have 
          a fully <strong>independent storyline</strong>. For example, unresolved 
          conflicts from a deceased character should not carry over to a new one.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Best Practices to Avoid Meta-Gaming</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid watching streams or meta chats:</strong> Do not view or participate 
            in live streams or chats related to your active storyline, especially those involving 
            conflicts with your character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In-the-moment roleplay:</strong> While some pre-planning (e.g., for 
            consent in torture scenes) may be necessary, extensive <strong>OOC discussion</strong> 
            or planning is discouraged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Character Background Communication:</strong> You may discuss backstories 
            with other players, but <strong>do not share IC information</strong> (e.g., location 
            of your character or events) outside of in-character methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unconscious Characters:</strong> Any information “gathered” while 
            unconscious <strong>cannot</strong> be remembered upon regaining consciousness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid rerolling into the same group/gang:</strong> If your character 
            is permanently killed, do not immediately rejoin the same group or gang. Take time 
            before reconnecting to prevent meta-gaming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep multiple characters truly separate:</strong> If you have multiple 
            characters, they should not share storylines or conflicts. If they do, 
            <strong>bench one character</strong> until the conflict is resolved 
            to avoid potential overlap or meta-gaming issues.

      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Power Gaming</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          <strong>Power-gaming</strong> occurs when a player prioritizes personal success 
          or “winning” at the expense of other players’ experiences, undermining the 
          collaborative and immersive nature of roleplay.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Examples of Power-Gaming</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Never losing a fight:</strong> Always avoiding defeat in combat, regardless 
            of realistic or roleplay context.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refusing realistic consequences of injuries:</strong> Never fully accepting 
            unconsciousness or death when realistically downed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overuse of lassos and hogties:</strong> Constantly tying other players down 
            to maintain control or avoid in-character repercussions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retaining perfect memory post-injury:</strong> Remembering all details 
            after being knocked unconscious.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expecting victims to forget crimes:</strong> Insisting that characters or NPCs 
            have no recollection of wrongdoings committed against them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>“Jack-of-all-trades” characters:</strong> Creating overly powerful characters 
            with no weaknesses or realistic limitations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PvPing solely to “win”:</strong> Engaging in combat with the main goal of 
            victory rather than meaningful roleplay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overuse of execution animations:</strong> Frequently performing executions, 
            especially in PvP, which can detract from immersion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Using meta-information for gain:</strong> Employing OOC knowledge to influence 
            in-character decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Denying opponents a chance to respond:</strong> Initiating attacks without 
            giving others time to react or roleplay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exploiting wagon depots:</strong> Stashing or moving wagons unrealistically 
            to bypass in-character law enforcement or skip parts of criminal activities.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          By avoiding these behaviors, players can maintain an <strong>immersive, fair, 
          and collaborative</strong> environment that benefits the entire community.

      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Roping and Hog Tie</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          Because lassos and hogties <strong>severely restrict</strong> a player's ability 
          to act or escape, they should be used <strong>sparingly</strong> and 
          <strong>realistically</strong>. Abusing these mechanics can ruin immersion 
          and diminish roleplay opportunities.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Best Practices for Using Lassos & Hogties</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Last resort:</strong> Avoid making lassoing or hogtying 
            your first action. Build up through roleplay before resorting to 
            physically restraining someone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No immediate breakouts:</strong> Once a player is hogtied, 
            <strong>do not</strong> break free unless there is a <strong>significant, 
            realistic reason</strong> to do so.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>When Breaking Out May Be Appropriate</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Out of shouting range:</strong> If your captor is far enough away 
          that they realistically wouldn’t hear or see your escape attempt, 
          it may be acceptable to try to break free.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Left unattended:</strong> If you’re left alone for a significant 
          period, consider a break-out attempt if it makes sense in the context.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Major distractions:</strong> Distractions such as gunfire or explosions 
          may offer a realistic window to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Explicit permission:</strong> If your captor allows or instructs you 
          in-character or via OOC channels to attempt escape, it’s permissible—provided 
          both parties agree to maintain the scene’s immersion.

      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Group Size and Criminal Organization Rules</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          Criminal organizations (or gangs) in Las Islas Filipinas must have a 
          <strong>minimum of 6 members</strong> and a <strong>maximum of 10</strong>. 
          Additionally, each member must have at least <strong>100 in-game hours</strong> 
          before joining or forming a criminal group. This ensures groups are serious, 
          dedicated, and that each player understands our roleplay environment.
        </p>
  
        <h3>1. Membership Limits & 100-Hour Requirement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimum 6, Maximum 10:</strong> You cannot form a recognized 
            criminal group with fewer than 6 members or more than 10. Once a group reaches 10, 
            no additional players may join or affiliate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>100 Hours of Gameplay:</strong> Every prospective criminal 
            group member must accumulate <strong>at least 100 hours</strong> on the server 
            before joining. This ensures they have enough experience to engage in 
            high-quality, immersive RP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affiliation Restrictions:</strong> Do not attempt to bypass 
            the 6–10 limit by splitting a large, 10+ group into “sister gangs.” 
            Each organization must be independent, with its own leadership, roster, and storyline.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>2. Active PvP Participation (6-Person Rule)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Combat Limit:</strong> During any PvP event (firefights, melees), 
            only <strong>6 members</strong> from your group may actively participate. Others 
            must remove themselves from the area or remain clearly uninvolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Staff Approval:</strong> If there’s a strong roleplay reason to exceed 6 in active combat, 
            obtain <strong>staff approval</strong> beforehand.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>3. No Cross-Gang Alliances</h3>
        <p>
          Gangs <strong>cannot form alliances</strong> with other criminal organizations. 
          You may <em>trade</em> or <em>purchase</em> items from each other but cannot coordinate 
          crimes or share manpower. Each group’s illegal activities must remain separate, 
          preventing multi-gang “super factions.”
        </p>
  
        <h3>4. Splitting Large Gangs</h3>
        <p>
          If a group naturally grows beyond 10, you must form a fully 
          <strong>separate</strong> organization with distinct leadership, membership, and identity. 
          They cannot act as “branches” that collectively exceed the membership cap.
        </p>
  
        <h3>5. Hiring Civilians & Government Jobs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hiring Civilians:</strong> Gangs may employ civilians for 
            non-criminal tasks only. Civilians cannot participate in illegal activity 
            unless it’s explicitly part of their roleplay. They <strong>cannot</strong> 
            be used to sidestep membership limits or boost numbers in conflicts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Government Employees:</strong> Anyone holding a government job 
            (lawman, EMS, etc.) is <strong>strictly forbidden</strong> from engaging in 
            criminal activity or joining a criminal organization. You must resign any 
            legitimate position and return official equipment before becoming a criminal.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          By adhering to these rules—maintaining a 6–10 membership range, requiring 100 hours of gameplay, 
          limiting active PvP participants, disallowing alliances, and separating criminals from 
          government jobs—our community preserves <strong>fair, immersive, and story-driven</strong> roleplay.

          Non-criminal civilian groups and law enforcement groups are limited to 
          <strong>6 armed participants</strong> in any firefight or melee. 
          This rule ensures fairness, balance, and immersive roleplay.
        </p>
  
        <h3>1. Rules for Group Size & Combat Involvement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Maximum Combatants:</strong> Only <strong>6 members</strong> 
            from a non-criminal or law enforcement group may actively participate in combat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Excess Members:</strong> If more than 6 are present, only the first 6 
            should engage. Additional members should <strong>refrain from fighting</strong> 
            unless staff approval is granted.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>2. Larger Groups for Non-Combat Purposes</h3>
        <p>
          Non-criminal civilians or law enforcement can gather in groups 
          <strong>larger than 6</strong> for activities like patrolling or attending events. 
          However, if combat occurs, only the first 6 participants may join the firefight 
          or melee without <strong>staff approval</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <h3>3. Staff Approval for Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
          Any scenario requiring <strong>more than 6</strong> armed non-criminal 
          or law enforcement members to engage in a firefight or melee must have 
          <strong>staff approval</strong> to maintain fairness and immersion.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Best Practices for Managing Group Size</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Combat Communication:</strong> Coordinate before 
            a firefight begins to designate which <strong>6 members</strong> will participate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Uninvolved Members:</strong> If your group is larger than 6, 
            non-participants should <strong>exit</strong> the combat zone or 
            <strong>avoid engaging</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> If you regularly exceed 
            the 6-member limit, consider <strong>breaking into smaller units</strong> 
            to comply with the rule.

      <div class="rules-panel">

          Criminal organizations and bandit groups must be rooted in compelling, 
          <strong>immersive storylines</strong> consistent with the server’s lore. 
          Their formation should reflect a solid understanding of criminal roleplay

          <strong>Bandits</strong> typically operate more informally on an individual level, 
          while <strong>criminal organizations</strong> are structured groups with 
          defined roles and goals. These two archetypes should remain distinct 
          unless a storyline organically merges them.
        </p>
  
        <h3>1. Group Size & Membership</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Groups must have a <strong>minimum of 6 members</strong> 
            and a <strong>maximum of 10 members</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            This balance helps maintain <strong>roleplay quality</strong> 
            and avoids technical issues like members not being visible or audible 
            in crowded areas.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>2. Required In-Game Hours</h3>
        <p>
          Every member must have at least <strong>100 in-game hours</strong> 
          before forming or joining a criminal group. This ensures 
          players possess adequate knowledge of the server’s systems, rules, 
          and community expectations.
        </p>
  
        <h3>3. Discretion & Identity</h3>
        <p>
          While operating in a criminal capacity, members must practice 
          <strong>discretion</strong>. However, they are required to identify themselves 
          using <strong>real names</strong> and the <strong>group’s name</strong> 
          during roleplay, reflecting common practices of the era.
        </p>
  
        <h3>4. Bounty & Law Enforcement Roleplay</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After <strong>3 successful robbery attempts</strong>, a bounty phase begins, 
            allowing <strong>bounty hunters</strong> to pursue the criminals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Criminals may attempt to <strong>hide</strong> in remote areas, but their real names 
            and crimes are generally known once a bounty is placed.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>5. No Legitimate Employment</h3>
        <p>
          Characters in criminal roles are <strong>not allowed</strong> to hold legitimate jobs 
          or serve in lawful organizations. Any interactions with lawful entities should strictly 
          align with the <strong>criminal narrative</strong>, ensuring authenticity and immersion.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          By following these guidelines, bandit groups and criminal organizations 
          contribute to <strong>dynamic, high-quality</strong> roleplay, shaping 
          meaningful interactions with law enforcement and bounty hunters, and 
          driving an evolving storyline for the entire community.

      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Conflict Initiation Rule for PvP Scenarios</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          The Conflict Initiation Rule ensures <strong>fair, balanced</strong>, and 
          <strong>immersive</strong> PvP roleplay. It outlines when and how players or groups 
          may initiate conflict, preventing unfair advantages and overcrowded scenarios.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Key Points of the Conflict Initiation Rule</h3>
  
        <h4>Single Conflict Initiation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>One group at a time:</strong> Multiple groups should not initiate conflict 
            against the same target for <strong>the same reason</strong> simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Group size cap:</strong> The total number of characters (including civilians) 
            involved on each side must not exceed <strong>10</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hiring outside help:</strong> You can hire another group to <em>respond</em> 
            to a conflict, but <strong>not</strong> to initiate it on your behalf.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Allies and Conflict</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Assisting each other:</strong> Characters may cooperate to initiate conflict 
            so long as the <strong>10-character limit</strong> is respected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid inserting into existing wars:</strong> Do not join a conflict 
            another gang or player group is already engaged in without a clear, separate roleplay reason.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Defensive Actions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-defense:</strong> Groups may defend themselves when attacked, 
            but must still follow the <strong>6 armed member</strong> rule for combat scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-participating members:</strong> Any characters above the 6-armed-member limit 
            must clear the area and <strong>not</strong> engage in the fight.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Conflict Balance</h4>
        <p>
          The goal is to maintain <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> for all involved. 
          Overwhelming other players with large numbers or using allies to <strong>power-game</strong> 
          (e.g., hunting down a group unfairly) is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.
        </p>
  
        <h3>What is <em>NOT</em> Allowed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bolstering numbers:</strong> Aiding an allied gang or person in conflict 
            to exceed the <strong>10-member</strong> limit is forbidden.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Revenge for allies:</strong> Taking revenge on behalf of an allied group 
            already in conflict with a third party is not allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inserting into existing conflicts:</strong> Intervening in a war already 
            in progress to “piggyback” on another group's conflict is prohibited.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>What <em>IS</em> Allowed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggression from rival gangs:</strong> If a rival gang (already in conflict 
            with another group) attacks your gang, you may <strong>retaliate</strong>—but do 
            not coordinate or “team up” with the other group also fighting them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Defending against outside aggression:</strong> It is always permissible 
            to defend yourself if another group initiates the fight.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Mixed Group Crimes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaboration between different groups:</strong> Criminals from separate 
            organizations can work together on a crime if it is <strong>well-supported by RP</strong>. 
            Constantly mixing multiple organizations, however, can cause confusion and 
            <strong>unfair advantages</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retaliation after mixed group crimes:</strong> If a mixed group performs 
            a crime (e.g., a bank robbery), they are only responsible for the members 
            <strong>present in the conflict</strong>. If another gang retaliates, they can 
            only target those who participated; other members of the same organizations 
            should <strong>not</strong> jump into the fight.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Hostages</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          All hostage scenarios on Las Islas Filipinas must be 
          <strong>completely organic</strong>—no out-of-character (OOC) pre-planning 
          is allowed. <strong>Government-employed characters</strong> (such as LEOs, EMS, 
          or other public servants) <strong>cannot</strong> be taken hostage during a heist 
          or criminal activity, and any captive LEOs <strong>must be released</strong> before 
          a heist starts.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          <strong>Hostages</strong> must not be willing participants unless there is 
          <strong>substantial roleplay</strong> justification. Disguised gang members, friends, 
          or fellow gang/family members <strong>cannot</strong> be used as hostages. 
          Demands should not exceed what is agreed upon during negotiations; 
          <strong>excessive or unrealistic</strong> demands may result in sanctions.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          While characters may trade themselves in as a hostage, it should occur only 
          under <strong>proper roleplay reasons</strong> and not become a frequent or casual practice. 
          These restrictions ensure that hostage situations remain <strong>fair</strong>, 
          <strong>realistic</strong>, and <strong>immersive</strong> for everyone involved.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Demands & Restrictions in Robberies with Hostages</h3>
        <h4>Demands to Hostage Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 Hostage = 2 Demands</strong></li>
          <li><strong>2 Hostages = 3 Demands</strong></li>
          <li><strong>3 Hostages (maximum) = 3 Demands</strong></li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Valid Demands</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Free passage</strong> or a delay of approximately 
            <strong>2–3 horses distance</strong> 
            (time delays cannot be demanded).
          </li>
          <li>
            A maximum of <strong>$100 per hostage</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strictly <strong>1 weapon</strong> only.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Restrictions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Hostages <strong>cannot be killed</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Hostages must be <strong>secured by at least 1–2 LEOs</strong> 
            before moving to the next phase of roleplay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No adding more hostages</strong> once the scenario has started.
          </li>
          <li>
            You cannot demand that LEOs <strong>enter the establishment</strong>, 
            <strong>dismount their horses</strong> (if already mounted), 
            or <strong>kneel down</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            During a horse chase, LEOs must give robbers a <strong>reasonable distance</strong> 
            before initiating pursuit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neither robbers nor LEOs</strong> may shoot or kill horses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lassos</strong> are <strong>not allowed</strong> during horse chases.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a shootout, LEOs may fire a <strong>warning shot</strong> (upward) for immersion, 
            but they <strong>cannot shoot first</strong> unless fired upon.

      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          <strong>Government employees</strong> must never engage in or aid any form 
          of criminal activity. Collaborating with criminal organizations—whether 
          <em>directly</em> or <em>indirectly</em>—is strictly prohibited. 
          As a representative of the government, your character is expected to 
          <strong>uphold integrity</strong> and <strong>responsibility</strong> 
          consistent with a public service role.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Any criminal act committed by a government official will be treated 
          as a <strong>rule violation</strong>. Government employees are held to a 
          <strong>higher standard</strong>, and unlawful activities undermine 
          both <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>realism</strong> within the server. 
          Characters found committing crimes may face <strong>in-character consequences</strong> 
          like arrest, suspension, or dismissal, fostering deeper and more immersive roleplay.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          While your character may display <strong>individual traits</strong>—such as 
          arrogance or hostility—these should not compromise the duties of a government role. 
          Maintain a <strong>clear separation</strong> between professional obligations 
          and personal demeanor to preserve the overall <strong>quality and realism</strong> 
          of the roleplay experience.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Staff members <strong>reserve the right</strong> to monitor and enforce these rules. 
          Violations may result in <strong>warnings</strong>, <strong>suspensions</strong>, 
          or <strong>permanent bans</strong>, depending on severity, to ensure fairness 
          and maintain a <strong>high-quality</strong> roleplay environment for everyone.

    <div class="rules-collapse">
      <button class="rules-toggle">+ Robbery and Hold-Up Roleplay</button>
      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          In Las Islas Filipinas, <strong>all robberies or heists</strong>—including stores, banks, 
          and similar large-scale thefts—<strong>require a hostage</strong> before proceeding. 
          This rule ensures that each scenario provides a meaningful RP opportunity 
          for criminals and law enforcement, rather than a quick “rob-and-go.”
        </p>

        <h3>1. Mandatory Hostage & No “Rob-and-Go”</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hostage Required:</strong> A robbery cannot officially begin until at least 
            <strong>one hostage</strong> is secured <em>organically</em> (no OOC pre-planning).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay On-Site:</strong> Once the robbery or heist starts, criminals must 
            <strong>remain on-location</strong> until law enforcement has a fair chance to respond. 
            Leaving immediately is considered “rob-and-go,” which is prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Government Hostages:</strong> LEOs, EMS, or other public servants 
            cannot be taken hostage. Any captive LEO must be released before a heist begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Willing or Staged Hostages:</strong> You may not use disguised gang members, 
            friends, co-gang members, or family as hostages. They must be genuinely non-involved.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Location of Robberies & Hold-ups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Outside Towns & Ranches (Recommended):</strong> To avoid disrupting law-abiding 
            citizens, standard hold-ups or robberies should ideally happen <strong>outside</strong> 
            of major towns or ranches. If criminals do initiate a robbery in a town or ranch, 
            they should be prepared for heavy resistance from the local populace or property owners.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. 6 Criminals vs. 6 Lawmen (Heist Limit)</h3>
        <p>
          For large-scale robberies (e.g., banks), <strong>up to 6 criminals</strong> and 
          <strong>6 lawmen</strong> may directly engage. If more arrive, only the first 6 on 
          each side actively participate. This keeps the situation balanced and non-chaotic.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Robbery Process & Interaction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Negotiations & Demands:</strong> State demands via roleplay 
            (money, safe passage, etc.). Avoid impossible or excessive demands 
            (e.g., time delays).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Handling the Hostage:</strong> Compliant hostages 
            <strong>must not be killed</strong>. Emphasize tension and negotiation, 
            rather than random violence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rummaging Inventories (ADDED):</strong> Criminals <strong>cannot</strong> 
            forcibly open pockets, rummage horses, or access others’ inventories. 
            You may only demand items that are visibly on the victim or voluntarily given.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Harm to Horses:</strong> Neither side should intentionally harm or kill 
            horses during or after the robbery. Focus on player interactions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Law Enforcement Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          Lawmen are expected to respond, negotiate, or attempt a stand-off. Criminals 
          should remain on-site until negotiations are concluded or fail. Both sides 
          should aim for a fair, story-driven resolution—rather than an instant shootout.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Conclusion of the Scenario</h3>
        <p>
          Once demands are resolved or negotiations break down, criminals may attempt to flee. 
          Law enforcement must have had a genuine chance to intervene. If a chase ensues, follow 
          established rules for combat and horse pursuit. <strong>Do not kill the hostage</strong> 
          out of frustration or convenience.

      <div class="rules-panel">
        <p>
          After a heist or robbery concludes, captured criminals may be transported to jail. 
          The following rules govern how their associates can (or cannot) intervene:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No “Palit Ulo”:</strong> You may not storm a town or take new hostages 
            in exchange for your arrested gang members. Bargaining for a swap (“palit ulo”) 
            is <strong>not allowed</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interception Only:</strong> You can only intercept the prisoner convoy 
            <strong>after</strong> it has left town. For instance, if 2 members of your 
            10-person gang are captured, the remaining 8 can attempt an ambush between 
            the town and Sisika Penitentiary—but not inside town limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Matching Numbers:</strong> Lawmen escorting the convoy should not exceed 
            the potential number of gang members who might intercept (e.g., if 8 members remain, 
            only 8 lawmen may actively engage).

          Criminals are required to adopt distinctive attire 
          that aligns with their gang or bandit group’s <strong>narrative</strong>. 
          This not only maintains immersion but also visually identifies your group.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Common Look:</strong> If your gang has a uniform, color theme, or 
            emblem, wear it consistently so others recognize you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Masks Optional:</strong> Masks are <strong>not required</strong>. 
            In fact, your identity is often known once you become a wanted criminal. 
            Masks can be used for style or primarily used for aesthetic purposes.

          Families in Las Islas Filipinas can have <strong>any number of members</strong>. 
          However, all members must be connected by a <strong>valid storyline</strong> 
          to avoid random, lore-breaking additions. If you wish to adopt a new surname

          <strong>DOJ RP</strong> process (e.g., legal name changes).
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. Forming a Family</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No Size Limit:</strong> There is no strict maximum on family members, 
            but each one must have a <strong>coherent backstory link</strong> to the family.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Structured Tree:</strong> Families must keep a logical family tree. 
            Randomly declaring someone your sibling or cousin requires 
            in-character justification.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Family Disputes & Conflict Duration</h3>
        <p>
          Family feuds can last up to <strong>3 days</strong>. On the 4th day, both families 
          must resolve it either through <strong>Peace Talks</strong> or a final showdown 
          (<strong>“High Noon” duel</strong>). 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Max 10 Per Side:</strong> If you do a final battle, 
            each family can bring at most 10 participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>50-Hour Requirement:</strong> Anyone joining the final showdown 
            must have at least 50 in-game hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Recruiting Outsiders:</strong> You cannot bring in unrelated 
            allies or “imports” just to bolster numbers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Government Affiliations</h3>
        <p>
          Members with government roles (lawmen, doctors, etc.) 
          <strong>cannot use</strong> their positions for unfair family advantages 
          (e.g., providing inside info or forbidden resources). Keep feuds 
          <strong>fair and unbiased</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          By following these guidelines—ensuring proper story connections, respecting 
          time-limited feuds, and upholding in-character legal processes—you’ll keep 
          family-based RP immersive and consistent with the server’s broader lore.
