        <h3>1. Downed & Unconscious States</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A character is <strong>Downed</strong> when critically injured but still conscious enough to communicate and receive immediate medical aid.</li>
          <li>A character becomes <strong>Unconscious</strong> if critically injured, unable to communicate clearly, and must wait for medical intervention.</li>
          <li>After recovering, the character must realistically forget the immediate events leading to injury and avoid immediate retaliation.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>2. Medical Assistance & Injury Roleplay</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Roleplay all injuries realistically, including pain, physical limitations, and necessary recovery time.</li>
          <li>Receiving medical treatment requires immersive and cooperative roleplay with medical professionals. Ignoring or instantly recovering from serious injuries is considered <strong>Power Gaming</strong>.</li>
          <li>Seek immediate medical assistance when injured or downed. Avoid unrealistic "instant recovery" or ignoring injuries.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Permadeath</strong> (permanent character death) requires explicit player consent and, once agreed upon, is irreversible.</li>
          <li>If a player sustains a clearly fatal injury (e.g., headshot), they cannot be revived and must invoke the <strong>New Life Rule (NLR)</strong>. This rule mandates the creation of a completely new character with no memory, affiliations, or knowledge from the previous character.</li>
          <li>Other players <strong>cannot force or impose permadeath</strong> without explicit out-of-character consent from the affected player.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          Adhering to these guidelines ensures realistic consequences, immersive storytelling, and fair interactions in Las Islas Filipinas.

        <h3>1. Family Formation & Structure</h3>

          <li>No limit on family size, but each member must have a clearly justified and valid storyline.</li>
          <li>Clearly define relationships and maintain a logical family tree. Random or unjustified additions require proper in-character justification.</li>
          <li>New surnames or officially joining a family requires an in-character DOJ-approved name change process.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>2. Family Disputes & Conflict Duration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Family disputes must have realistic, clearly established in-character motives and progression.</li>
          <li>Family feuds last a maximum of <strong>3 days</strong>. On the <strong>4th day</strong>, families must resolve conflict through Peace Talks or a final showdown (\"High Noon\" duel).</li>
          <li>Final showdown participant limit is explicitly <strong>10 per side</strong>, each participant requiring at least <strong>50 in-game hours</strong> and genuine family membership—no outside help allowed.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>3. Government Affiliations & Family RP</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Characters holding government or law enforcement roles must maintain strict separation between their official responsibilities and family affairs.</li>
          <li>Government-employed family members cannot show bias, favoritism, or provide insider advantages to their family. Violations result in disciplinary action.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Penalties include warnings, temporary suspensions, and permanent bans depending on the severity and frequency of violations.</li>
          <li>A <strong>third offense</strong>, regardless of severity, results in an automatic and irreversible <strong>permanent ban</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>2. Ban Appeals & Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Banned players may appeal <strong>once every 7 days</strong> through Discord support channels.</li>
          <li>Appeals must include substantial new evidence clearly demonstrating remorse, misunderstanding, or wrongful accusation.</li>
          <li>Repeated frivolous or disrespectful appeals may lead to extended bans or additional penalties.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>3. Confidentiality & Staff Discretion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Details regarding disciplinary actions remain confidential and are disclosed only if necessary for resolution.</li>
          <li>Staff decisions are final unless significant new evidence is presented during appeals.</li>
